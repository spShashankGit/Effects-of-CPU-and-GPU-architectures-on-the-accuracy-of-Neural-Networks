# Effects of CPU and GPU architectures on the accuracy of Neural Networks

This repo is created for master thesis project "Effects of CPU and GPU architectures on the accuracy of Neural Networks"

Idea:- The basic idea for this project is to examine why the same image classification code accuracy vary when executed on different set of hardware.

The repo consists of following codes to run:-

1. Logistic Map
2. VGG 11 based Image classifier



<br></br>
## Logistic Map code is available at this path:-

    cd Code/Logistic\ Map/


Run 

    python3  Logistic_Map_Script.py

<br></br>
## Image classification code is available at this path:-

    cd Code/VGG-11



Run

    python3 vgg_numpy.py
