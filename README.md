# Effects of CPU and GPU architectures on the accuracy of Neural Networks

This repo is created for master thesis project "Effects of CPU and GPU architectures on the accuracy of Neural Networks"

Idea:- The basic idea for this project is to examine why the same image classification code accuracy vary when executed on different set of hardware.

The repo consists of following codes to run:-

1. Logistic Map
2. VGG 11 based Image classifier

At the moment the code to run is in path:-

`Code/VGG-11`



Run

```python3 vgg_numpy.py```
